The subscription flow requires these API endpoints:

POST /api/subscriptions/create
Body: { planId: string }
Response: { checkoutUrl: string }

// Get current subscription
GET /api/subscriptions/current
Response: { planId: string, status: string, expiresAt: string }

POST /api/subscriptions/cancel
Body: { planId: string }
Response: { success: boolean }

// Update subscription
POST /api/subscriptions/update
Body: { newPlanId: string }
Response: { success: boolean }
```

## Payment Integration
