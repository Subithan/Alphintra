# Functional Requirements

## 1. Traders and External Developers

### Strategy Creation Suite

1. **Code-based Environment (IDE)**
   - The system shall provide a code-based environment (IDE) for traders to design, write, and manage trading strategies using the Python programming language.
   - **Explanation:** This is an integrated development environment, like a specialized code editor, where traders can type Python code to define the rules and logic of their trading strategies. They can write new strategies, modify existing ones, and organize their code files here.

2. **Python Software Development Kit (SDK)**
   - The system shall offer a Python Software Development Kit (SDK) with simplified commands and functions for common trading actions (e.g., placing orders, retrieving market data, accessing account information) and technical indicator calculations.
   - **Explanation:** This is a toolkit of pre-built Python commands specific to the trading platform. It allows traders to easily incorporate actions like buying/selling or fetching price data into their code using simple functions (e.g., platform.buy(), platform.get_price()) without needing to write complex code for these common tasks.

3. **Interactive Debugging Tools**
   - The code-based IDE shall feature interactive debugging tools, allowing traders to step through their Python strategy code using historical market data.
   - **Explanation:** This tool helps find errors in coded strategies. Traders can run their Python script line-by-line on past market data, seeing what the code does at each step, to identify and fix issues in their strategy's logic.

4. **Strategy Variable Visualization**
   - The interactive debugging tool shall allow traders to visualize the values of strategy variables and indicators on a chart corresponding to the historical data point being debugged.
   - **Explanation:** While debugging, traders can see key data from their strategy (like indicator values or account balance) displayed on a price chart for the specific past time they are examining. This helps visually confirm if the strategy is behaving as intended.

5. **Boilerplate Code Snippets**
   - The code-based IDE shall provide boilerplate code snippets for common trading logic structures (e.g., entry/exit conditions, risk management rules).
   - **Explanation:** These are ready-to-use small pieces of Python code for frequent tasks. For instance, a trader could insert a snippet for a standard "buy signal" structure and then just fill in the specific parameters, speeding up coding.

6. **Autocompletion Features**
   - The code-based IDE shall include autocompletion features for the platform's Python SDK functions and parameters.
   - **Explanation:** As traders type code, the IDE will suggest available platform-specific commands (from the SDK) and their required inputs. This helps in writing code faster and with fewer typing errors.

7. **No-Code Visual Interface**
   - The system shall provide a no-code, visual drag-and-drop interface for traders to build and configure trading strategies without writing code.
   - **Explanation:** This is a tool where traders can create trading strategies by graphically arranging and connecting pre-made blocks on a screen, instead of writing code. It's designed for users who prefer a visual approach or don't have coding skills.

8. **Connectable Building Blocks**
   - The visual interface shall allow traders to construct strategy logic using connectable building blocks representing conditions, actions, and logical operators (AND/OR).
   - **Explanation:** Traders build their strategy by selecting blocks that represent specific market conditions (e.g., 'price is above X'), trading actions (e.g., 'sell Y amount'), or logical rules (e.g., 'IF condition A AND condition B are met'). They then link these blocks together in a sequence to define the strategy's flow.

9. **Strategy Condition Building Blocks**
   - The system shall offer a library of configurable building blocks for strategy conditions, including but not limited to:
     - Indicator-based conditions (e.g., RSI, Moving Averages) with user-definable parameters (e.g., period, threshold)
     - Price-action-based conditions (e.g., price breakouts, candlestick patterns)
     - Time-based conditions (e.g., trading sessions, time triggers)
     - Portfolio-based conditions (e.g., unrealized profit/loss, risk limits)
   - **Explanation:** This is a collection of pre-defined elements traders can drag into their visual strategy. Each block represents a specific market condition (like 'RSI is below 30' or 'it's 10:00 AM') which can be customized (e.g., changing the RSI period).

10. **Strategy Action Building Blocks**
    - The system shall offer a library of configurable building blocks for strategy actions, including but not limited to:
      - Order execution actions (e.g., Buy, Sell specific units/percentage)
      - Risk management actions (e.g., Set Stop Loss, Set Trailing Stop Loss, Take Profit)
    - **Explanation:** Similar to condition blocks, these are pre-defined elements for actions the strategy can take (like 'place a buy order' or 'set a stop-loss at X%'). Traders can customize the parameters of these actions.

11. **Live Preview**
    - The visual interface shall provide a live preview (textual summary or mini-flowchart) of the strategy logic as it is being constructed by the trader.
    - **Explanation:** As the trader drags and connects blocks in the visual builder, a section of the screen will show a simple description or a diagram of the strategy being built. This gives immediate feedback on how the logic is forming.

12. **Built-in Sanity Checks**
    - The visual interface shall incorporate built-in sanity checks to provide warnings or guidance on potentially conflicting or incomplete strategy logic.
    - **Explanation:** The system will automatically check the visually built strategy for common errors or omissions (e.g., a buy rule without any sell rule) and alert the trader, helping them create more robust strategies.

13. **Pre-built Strategy Templates**
    - The system shall provide traders with access to a library of pre-built trading strategy templates.
    - **Explanation:** This is a collection of ready-to-use sample trading strategies. Traders can use these as a starting point for their own strategies or to learn how different strategies are structured.

14. **Template Documentation**
    - Each strategy template shall include a concise explanation of its logic and intended use case.
    - **Explanation:** Every template will have a short description explaining what the strategy tries to achieve (e.g., "buys on strong upward momentum") and how it generally works.

15. **No-Code Template Integration**
    - Traders shall be able to open a no-code template directly in the visual strategy builder to view and understand its construction.
    - **Explanation:** If a template is designed for the no-code system, traders can load it into the visual editor to see exactly how it's built with the various blocks, making it easy to learn from or modify.

16. **Template Cloning**
    - Traders shall be able to clone any pre-built strategy template into their personal workspace to customize and use it.
    - **Explanation:** Traders can make a personal copy of any template. This allows them to modify it freely without changing the original template, tailoring it to their specific needs.

17. **Code-based Template Loading**
    - Traders shall be able to load pre-built strategy templates into the code-based IDE if the template has an equivalent code version or can be translated.
    - **Explanation:** If a template also exists as Python code, or can be converted to it, traders using the code-based environment can load it there to study or adapt the underlying code.
