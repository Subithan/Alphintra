# Alphintra Frontend Development Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the development plan for the Alphintra web application's frontend. The plan is based on the functional requirements, user roles, and technical specifications detailed in the project proposal. The primary goal is to create a responsive, intuitive, and high-performance user interface that caters to the diverse needs of our users, from novice traders to professional developers and administrators.

## 2. Guiding Principles & Technology Stack

The frontend will be developed as a modern, single-page application (SPA) adhering to the following principles:

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI will be constructed from a set of reusable, independent, and testable components, promoting consistency and maintainability.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application will be fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience across a wide range of devices, from desktops to tablets.
*   **Performance First:** The application will be optimized for speed, with a focus on fast initial page loads, efficient data fetching, and smooth user interactions, which is critical for a trading platform.
*   **Accessibility:** The UI will be designed to be accessible to all users, following WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) best practices.

### Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a utility-first styling approach, allowing for rapid development of a custom design system.
*   **State Management:** Zustand for simple, scalable global state management (e.g., user authentication, theme). Local component state will be managed with React Hooks.
*   **Data Fetching & Caching:** GraphQL with Apollo Client. This allows for efficient data fetching, declarative queries, and robust caching, which is ideal for the complex data requirements of the dashboard.
*   **Charting:** A specialized library like `TradingView Lightweight Charts` or `ECharts` will be used for financial data visualization.
*   **Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library for unit/integration tests; Playwright for end-to-end tests.

## 3. Project Structure

The Next.js project will follow a feature-based organization within the `app` directory:

```
/app
  /api/                # API routes (GraphQL Yoga server)
  /components/         # Shared, reusable UI components (Buttons, Inputs, Modals)
  /lib/                # Helper functions, GraphQL client setup, constants
  /hooks/              # Custom React hooks
  /store/              # Zustand state management store
  /(auth)/             # Route group for authentication pages
    /login/page.tsx
    /register/page.tsx
  /(dashboard)/        # Main application layout after login
    /layout.tsx        # Main layout with sidebar and header
    /dashboard/        # Main dashboard overview
    /strategy-hub/     # Strategy creation (IDE & No-Code)
    /marketplace/      # Strategy marketplace
    /paper-trading/    # Paper trading dashboard
    /live-trading/     # Live trading dashboard
    /developer/        # Developer earnings and analytics
    /admin/            # Admin-specific panels
    /support/          # Customer support tools
    /settings/         # User settings
```

## 4. Key Features & Component Breakdown

This section details the frontend implementation plan for the platform's core features.

### 4.1. User Authentication & Onboarding

*   **Views:** Login, Register, Forgot Password, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) setup.
*   **Components:** `LoginForm`, `RegisterForm`, `AuthLayout`, `InputField`, `Button`.
*   **Logic:** Securely handle user input, communicate with the User & Auth Service via GraphQL mutations, manage JWT tokens in client-side storage (secure cookies), and protect routes based on authentication status.

### 4.2. The Trader's Dashboard (Core Experience)

*   **Views:** Main Dashboard, Live Trading, Paper Trading, Portfolio Overview.
*   **Components:**
    *   `PortfolioSummaryCard`: Displays key metrics (total value, P&L).
    *   `PositionsTable`: Lists all current open positions (live or paper).
    *   `ActiveBotsList`: Shows all currently running trading bots.
    *   `RealTimeChart`: The main financial chart component.
    *   `TradeLog`: A real-time feed of executed trades.
    *   `AlertsFeed`: Displays notifications for significant events.
*   **Logic:** This area will heavily rely on GraphQL subscriptions (via WebSockets) for real-time updates to P&L, positions, and trade logs to avoid constant polling and ensure low latency.

### 4.3. Strategy Creation Suite

This is a dual-feature area requiring two distinct interfaces.

**A. No-Code Visual Builder:**

*   **Views:** A full-screen, interactive canvas for building strategies.
*   **Components:**
    *   `StrategyCanvas`: The main drag-and-drop area.
    *   `BlocksSidebar`: A library of draggable condition and action blocks (e.g., `RSIBlock`, `BuyOrderBlock`).
    *   `ConfigPanel`: A panel to configure the parameters of a selected block.
    *   `LivePreview`: A component that provides a textual or flowchart summary of the constructed logic.
*   **Logic:** This will be the most complex UI component, requiring a robust drag-and-drop library (e.g., `DND Kit`) and complex state management to represent the strategy's logic tree.

**B. Code-Based IDE:**

*   **Views:** A multi-tabbed code editor interface.
*   **Components:**
    *   `CodeEditor`: An embedded code editor like Monaco Editor (the engine for VS Code) with Python syntax highlighting and autocompletion.
    *   `FileTree`: A sidebar to manage strategy code files.
    *   `TerminalOutput`: A panel to show logs from backtesting or deployment.
    *   `InteractiveDebugger`: A component to visualize variable values on a chart during a debugging session.
*   **Logic:** The frontend will provide the editor interface, while the backend handles the execution, debugging, and autocompletion suggestions.

### 4.4. Strategy Marketplace

*   **Views:** Marketplace Home, Strategy Profile Page, Developer Profile Page.
*   **Components:**
    *   `StrategyCard`: A summary card for each strategy, showing key stats (ROI, risk) and user rating.
    *   `SearchAndFilterBar`: Allows users to search and filter strategies by various criteria.
    *   `PerformanceChart`: Displays the historical performance of a strategy.
    *   `ReviewsSection`: Lists user reviews and ratings.
*   **Logic:** The frontend will use GraphQL queries to fetch and display marketplace data. It will handle pagination for browsing large numbers of strategies.
