# Alphintra Backend Development Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive backend development plan for the Alphintra trading platform. The plan is derived from the detailed project proposal and adheres to the architectural principles, technological choices, and functional requirements defined therein. The goal is to create a scalable, secure, and resilient backend capable of supporting all platform features, from the core trading engine to the AI-driven marketplace.

## 2. Guiding Principles & Architecture

The backend will be built upon a modern, cloud-native foundation, adhering to the following principles:

*   **Microservices Architecture:** The system will be decomposed into small, independent, and loosely coupled services. This promotes scalability, fault isolation, and allows for independent development and deployment.
*   **Event-Driven Communication:** Asynchronous communication using Apache Kafka will be the primary method for inter-service collaboration. This decouples services, enhances resilience, and ensures high throughput for data streams like market data and trade events.
*   **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Each microservice will be aligned with a specific business domain (e.g., Trading, User Management, Marketplace), ensuring clear boundaries and responsibilities.
*   **Cloud-Native Deployment:** The entire backend is designed to be deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Docker containers and orchestrated with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), leveraging managed services for databases, caching, and messaging.
*   **Security by Design:** Security is a foundational concern, with measures implemented at every layer, from infrastructure (VPC Service Controls, mTLS) to the application (secure coding, dependency scanning, robust authentication).

## 3. Backend Microservices

The backend will be composed of the following core microservices:

---

### 3.1. Core Trading Engine

*   **Purpose:** To provide the central, high-performance engine for all trading-related operations. This is a mission-critical component where latency and reliability are paramount.
*   **Primary Technology:** Java 21+ with Spring Boot 3.x (utilizing Project Reactor for non-blocking I/O).

## 4. Data Storage & Communication

### 4.1. Data Storage

*   **PostgreSQL (Cloud SQL):** The primary relational database for structured, transactional data. It will store user accounts, wallet balances, order details, and strategy configurations.
*   **TimescaleDB (on GCP):** A PostgreSQL extension for time-series data. It will store all historical and real-time market data (ticks, candles), which is essential for backtesting and analysis.
*   **Redis (Cloud Memorystore):** An in-memory data store used for caching user sessions, frequently accessed market data, and implementing rate limiting.

### 4.2. Communication Strategy

*   **API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway):** A single, unified entry point for all client requests (web and mobile). It will handle request routing to the appropriate microservice, authentication (JWT validation), rate limiting, and aggregation of responses.
*   **Asynchronous Communication (Apache Kafka):** The event-driven backbone of the system. Key topics will include:
    *   `market_data_ingest`: Raw market data from various sources.
    *   `trade_execution_signals`: Signals from strategies to the trading engine.
    *   `order_status_updates`: Real-time updates on order state (e.g., PENDING, FILLED, CANCELED).
    *   `trade_confirmations`: Confirmed trade executions.
    *   `user_events`: Events like `user_registered`, `password_reset`.
    *   `notification_dispatch`: Events that trigger user notifications (email, push).

## 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns

*   **Observability:**
    *   **Logging:** All services will output structured (JSON) logs to be aggregated in Google Cloud Logging.
    *   **Metrics:** Services will expose metrics in a Prometheus format, to be scraped by Google Cloud Monitoring.
    *   **Tracing:** Distributed tracing will be implemented via Istio and Cloud Trace to debug requests across the service mesh.
*   **Security:**
    *   **Authentication:** Handled by the User & Auth Service using JWTs.
    *   **Service-to-Service:** All communication within the GKE cluster will be secured with mutual TLS (mTLS), enforced by the Istio service mesh.
    *   **Secrets Management:** All secrets (API keys, database passwords) will be stored securely in GCP Secret Manager.
